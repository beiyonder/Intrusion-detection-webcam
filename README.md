# Intrusion-detection-webcam
This project done in Wolfram Mathematica in collaboration with my classmate Shantanu.
The code takes dynamic images and converts the image data into gray scale and then overlaps the consecutive images 
to see if there are any changes. If it finds any change it makes a beep sound.
